Lab 2: Basic arcpy operations and vector analysis
=================================================
for GEOG 410/510 winter term 2015


**Overview**

Lab 2 consists of two parts, and each part requires a separate script.
The overall goal of this lab is to import some existing data layers in shapefile
and .img raster file formats from the data folder into a geodatabase (Part 1),
and to use the geodatabase feature class layers for a short analysis (Part 2).


**Part 1: Importer Script (14 points)**

The importer should create a file geodatabase in the output folder,
and import the shapefiles and raster files in the data folder into the new geodatabase.
If the importer fails to import a file for some reason, the script should not
fail, but should continue after reporting the error to the user in a useful manner.


**Part 2: Analysis Script (20 points)**

The analysis script will use the feature classes imported into the geodatabase
created in Part 1, but should be implemented in such a way that changing the
analysis geodatabase is trivial (e.g. use a constant). The analysis should perform
the following steps:

1. Check to ensure the analysis geodatabase has the required layers:
    - at least one point layer
    - at least one polyline layer
    - a layer named `study_area`

2. Buffer each point layer in the geodatabase.
   Only features in a layer with the field `toBuff` set to "True" should be buffered.
   The buffer distance should be set using the values in the `buff_dist` field.

3. Merge all buffer polygon layers into a single polygon layer. It does not matter
   if the features are dissolved into a single feature, or remain separated.

4. Buffer each polyline layer in the geodatabase.
   Only buffer lines greater than 9,000 feet in length (query the `LENGTH` field)
   also intersected by the polygons in the `study_area` feature class.
   The buffer should be 1 Mile, should be on both sides of the lines (`"FULL"`),
   and should cap the ends of the lines (`"ROUND"`).

5. The buffer layers from the line features should be merged into a single feature
   class. The features should not be dissolved together.

6. Erase the merged point buffers layer from the merged line buffers layer.

7. Create a fishnet grid of geometry type polygon with a
   5000-foot by 5000-foot cell size.
   The extent should match the extent of the erase results feature class.
   Do not generate label points.
   Intersect the grid with the erase results, and find the centroids of the
   resulting polygons. Report the number of centroids to the user.

   **Record the number of centroids as reported by your script, and add the
   number to your header comment in your script on a line like:**

      # Centroid count: <number of centroids>

The script should output two and only two feature classes to the analysis geodatabase:

- The results of the erase operation from step 6

- The centroid feature class from step 7


**Tips and Hints**

- Don't forget a try/except in Part 1.

- Make use of the ArcGIS `in_memory` workspace for intermediate files.

- Feature layers are required for some selection tools in arcpy.

- Follow the code guideline for the course.


**What to submit**

You need only submit your completed .py files. See the general lab instructions
(README in the 410Labs repo) for submission instructions.


**Lab Grading**

This lab is worth a total of
34 points:
14 points for Part 1 and
20 points for Part 2.
Following the grading breakdown outlined in the code guidelines for the course,
comments, format/style/readability, variable names, and the user interface are
each worth 12.5 percent of the points. Proper programming structures and logic
are worth 25 percent of the total. Meeting the assignment
requirements outlined above is worth an additional 25 percent.

Failure to make a reasonable attempt to complete
one of the parts of the lab  will result
in an automatic loss of all points for that part.
Code that does not make a reasonable attempt to address
any part of the lab will get an automatic 0.
